# o-UMultiVLM
Unsteady Full Multi-wake Vortex Lattice Method ("original" version; only for multi-wake dynamics verification).
Fortran (Visual Studio Project)

1. You should have installed Visual Studio 2017 (or higher version) and "GiD" (pre and post-processor).
2. Open UMultiVLM.vfproj
3. Go to input.txt (optional to change parameters).
4. Press "start" to run the code (and wait to ends).
5. To visualize the results (multi-wake dynamics) change to post-processor mode in GiD and open/drag the .msh file.
6. Enjoy!
